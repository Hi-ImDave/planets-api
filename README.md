ideas: each planet in database can have an array of facts (should each fact be its own object?). Facts can be pulled at random depending on the planet being viewed.

# Henry's Space Odyssey Planets API
Henry's Space Odyssey Planets API is an educational API that currently contains facts and information about the planets within our solar system

**Full Website:** https://hso-planet-api.herokuapp.com/api/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, Heroku

This is my first time building server-side code. I built this with the intention of using it in another project of mine, Henry's Space Odyssey. I decided to keep server and client-side code separate to maintain the API's usability across the web.

## Optimizations

Each planet in database can have an array of facts (should each fact be its own object?). Facts can be pulled at random depending on the planet being viewed. Will be adding dwarf planets, solar systems, galaxies, moons and universe information.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to create an API and host it on heroku.
